This program will allow you to feed in an image into a local hosted website which then allows you to automatically populate your Google calendar.

The code here is the basic outline. In order to use the repo you will need to have AWS's CLI installed and region set to US-WEST-2. And to have Google's credentials.json which can be obtained here: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started.

On our official website deployment (IN PROGRESS) this will all be done in the back-end and the user need only to submit an image of their schedule to populate Google calendar with their courses.
